# hello there
i'm moon, a front-end programmer from upstate ny that makes things look pretty.

### what do i do?
i specialize in html5, css, node.js development and anything else that looks cool.

### how do i do it?
with a bit of magic and countless hours of reading stackoverflow guides, my main tools for making my random projects are visual studio, visual studio code, replit and git-scm.


> "how did i do that. wait, it works? what." - me, probably not too long ago.
